Internet Gateaway

- It's a VPC component which is horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available that allows communication between the VPC and the internet. 
- Supports IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
- Does not cause availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.

What is a subnet?

- Range of IP addresses to create and deploy resources, like instances or load balancers.
- They allow to segmenet your VPC into smaller networks, which can be used to isolate different resources and control network traffic.
